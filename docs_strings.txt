
    The function `show_application_page()` in the Streamlit app sets up the user interface for
    generating time series forecasts using the Prophet library, allowing users to upload data, configure
    forecasting parameters, visualize results, evaluate model performance, and export forecast results.
    
    :param df: `df` is a pandas DataFrame that contains the time series data after it has been loaded
    and prepared for forecasting. It includes the date column labeled as 'ds' and the values column
    labeled as 'y'
    :param date_col: The `date_col` parameter is used to specify the column in your dataset that
    contains the date or timestamp information. This column will be renamed as **ds** to comply with
    Prophet's requirements for time series forecasting. It is essential for creating time series
    forecasts based on historical data
    :param metric_col: The `metric_col` parameter refers to the column in your dataset that contains the
    values you want to forecast. This column should be numeric as it represents the metric or
    measurement you are interested in predicting. When preparing the data for forecasting, this column
    will be labeled as **y** to comply with Prophet
    :return: The code provided defines a Streamlit web application for time series forecasting using the
    Prophet library. The application consists of multiple sections including data loading, parameter
    configuration, forecasting, model validation, hyperparameter tuning, and exporting results.
